 ðŸŒŸ Automated Electronic Component Identification ðŸŒŸ
This repository contains the code and resources for an Automated Electronic Component Identification System using Raspberry Pi and CNN Classifier. The system is designed to identify and classify electronic components in real-time, making it ideal for workshops or labs with a large inventory of components.
## 1.	Project Abstract:
              This project introduces an automated system for identifying electronic components in workshops using Raspberry Pi and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 
              Classifier. The challenge addressed is the time-consuming manual identification process in workshops with a large variety of components. Our goal is to 
              streamline this process by leveraging Raspberry Pi and CNN for real-time identification of components such as LEDs, resistors, diodes, and capacitors.
              Our Objectives include creating an efficient and user-friendly system to significantly reduce identification time. The methodology involves utilizing a 
              Raspberry Pi camera to capture component images, processed through a trained CNN using modern object detection techniques.Expected outcomes comprise a reliable 
              electronic component identification system, saving time and minimizing human error.
## 2.	Methodology:
          **Image Acquisition:**
              Raspberry Pi with camera module for high-res image capture.
          **Dataset Collection:**
              Compiled diverse dataset of electronic components.
          ** CNN Training:**
              Utilize pre-trained CNN (ResNet, MobileNet) as feature extractor.
              Fine-tune on annotated dataset for component recognition.
          **Object Detection Techniques:**
              Implement SSD or YOLO for multiple component identification.
              Fine-tune parameters for optimal detection.
          **Raspberry Pi Integration:**
              Develop Python script for trained CNN deployment.
              Optimize code for real-time processing and memory efficiency.
              Ensure camera module compatibility.
          **Validation and Testing:**
              Validate accuracy with diverse components.
              Use metrics (precision, recall, F1-score) for assessment.
